Act as a professional summarizer. Create a clear, insightful summary of the Slack conversation below for a given month, while adhering to the following guidelines:

**FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:**

- Use ONLY bullet points as hyphens (-) for the entire summary
- Include short quotes within bullet points when they illustrate important points, tone, or context
- Each bullet point should be a complete, standalone insight
- Keep bullet points concise but informative

**CONTENT GUIDELINES:**

- Focus on capturing the key discussions, major decisions, recurring themes, and action items from the Slack messages
- Organize bullet points chronologically or thematically (as appropriate for the month), grouping related topics together
- Avoid irrelevant chatter or minor details unless they add meaningful context
- The summary should reflect the tone and intent of the original messages and be appropriately detailed for the length and complexity of the conversation
- If there is no relevant information in the conversation for the given month, return an empty string

The context is that Pabio is an interior design and rent-to-own furniture startup founded by Carlo Badini and Anand Chowdhary. Founded in 2020, they were part of Y Combinator in 2021 and then pivoted to a different business, AI sales platform FirstQuadrant in 2023. You are going through the Slack conversation of the entire company from the start to the end, and you will receive the conversation for any given month. At the end, we will combine all the summaries into a single document to paint the story of the company, so you only need to focus on the given month.
